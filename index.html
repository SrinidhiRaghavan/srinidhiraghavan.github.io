                                                I am a second-year graduate student specializing in Machine Learning from the Computer Science Department at <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Columbia University, New York </a>. My interests revolve around Machine Learning and its applications in the domain of finance and medicine. Currently, I am working under <a href="http://www.hodlipson.com/">Prof. Hod Lipson</a> in <a href="http://www.creativemachineslab.com/research.html">Creative Machines Lab</a> on 3D Food Printing. I am also extending my work under <a href="https://psychology.barnard.edu/faculty-staff/part-time"> Prof. Pat Stokes </a> on developing a math puzzle for enhancing the logical capabilities of young children.   
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.sfitengg.org/">St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai</a> in 2015. During my under-graduation, I worked under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cCWvPZkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Kavita Sonawane </a> on <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6909718/?reload=true">Improvising the existing Video Summarization Techniques</a>. The work was also awarded as one of the best projects in 2015. Besides academics, I was into various extra-curricular activities during this tenure. I was a core committee member of Entrepreneurship Cell, Placement Cell and also co-founded a non-profit organization for spreading the awareness of cleanliness.

                                                During Summer- 2017, I worked with the Algorithmic Trading Team in <a href="http://www.jefferies.com/">Jefferies LLC</a>, a New-York based Investment Banking Firm, as a Software Developer Intern. My responsibilities revolved around regression analysis, data visualization and software developer. Before this internship, I worked as a Software Developer in the Data Analytics team in a start-up based in Mumbai.

                                                I would describe myself as a confident, bubbling individual with the quest to learn more and more, ability to gel well in a team, be cool during pressure and manage time effectively. I would like to enhance these strengths by working in a well-knit team of intellectuals working in the domain of Machine Learning. My ultimate objective is to employ learning techniques for the upliftment of medical informatics.

                                            <p> 
                                                During my internship at Jefferies, I worked on two projects – Client Alpha and BARRA Risk Analysis, with the high-frequency algorithmic trading team in Equity Division.                                             
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Client Alpha aimed to systematically produce alpha of a client, which is the excess information shared by a client. I implemented various regression models in Python which could fit a statistically-confident data and predict residual risk accurately for every client. Besides, I had worked on developing a end-to-end internal web application which visualizes the various financial details like Volatility curve, for clients and gives the predicted alpha score. Technologies like C#, AngularJS, Onetick and R were used.    
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In BARRA Risk Analysis Project, I developed a software which periodically looked for ﬁles, updated the database and connected to a web service to compute the ultimate risk of a portfolio for various projects. The entire process had to be optimized to improve the time taken to scrawl across a multitude of files and update over 10M rows at once. The application was scheduled by batch to update whenever there is a modification. The project was developed in C# and its initial scope was researched in R. A Java utility was recreated for the same.

                                            Developed a C++ library to implement ensemble methods, which are believed to have a upper edge in performance as compared to other standalone applications. Supervised algorithms like logistic regression, SVM, KNN, perceptron where used as the standalone counterparts. The library was tested against two use cases – Viola Jones Face Detection and Cancer Prediction. It was also benchmarked against C++’s MLPack, Java’s Weka and Python’s scikit-learn. The Armadillo implementation of the library proved to supersede the peers in logistic regression and cumulative ensemble method implementation

The discrete combinatorial optimization problem was solved using a newly devised algorithm, which as opposed to many current technologies provides the optimal automated solution to both passengers and drivers. AWS components like DynamoDB, SNS, SQS and Elastic Beanstalk, where used to realize the project

                                            The lack of ways to automatically generate summaries from videos can make the process of watching surveillance videos tedious and time consuming. It is also human to miss out on the interesting features from such long CCTV tapes. This problem motivated the project, where-in various clustering techniques on sparsely coded videos which was generated using histogram of optical flow and histogram of gradients. The techniques were compared using 3 parameters – processing time, accuracy and length of output video. An average processing time of 1/24 was achieved on videos over length 65 minutes. The final application was awarded as one of the best in the gradschool in 2015
